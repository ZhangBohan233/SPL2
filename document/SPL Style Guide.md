### Naming Styles

Here are the common naming styles for different type of names:

* **Class Names**: `CamelCase` is recommended.

* **Function Names**: `lower_case_with_underscore` is recommended.

* **Variable Names**: `lower_case_with_underscore` is recommended.

* **Constant Names**: For local constants, `lower_case_with_underscore`
is recommended. But for macro constants, `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORE`
is recommended.
